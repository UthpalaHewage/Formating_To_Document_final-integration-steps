THE LISTLIKE SENTENCE

------------------------------------------------

‘The thing about a sentence with a listlike form is that there are a
number of tiny points with independent bits of meaning that are
set out in the sentence in a line so that the series of words and
phrases reads like so many pieces of popcorn strung out ona
string’. —
